## 2D heterogeneous distribution
Reconstruction of an heterogeneous distribution of particles generated with a Random Walk Particle Tracking solver on a two dimensional heterogeneous aquifer. 

The `python` routine `plotoutput.py` generates a figure comparing the smoothed and histogram density reconstruction. Be sure that the packages `numpy, pandas and matplotlib` are installed. If not, a `requirements.txt` file is included and can be installed with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
